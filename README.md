# RP2040 3D Engine

Welcome to the project page where I am making a 3D engine for a console project based on RP 2xxx microcontrollers from Raspberry Pi!
When I bought myself a Raspberry Pi Pico, I saw a huge potential in developing devices based on this board.
I write in C/C++ in PicoSDK to minimize the burden of arduino libraries or speed up work relative to the micropython program
